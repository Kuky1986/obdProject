      <p className="info-message">
        Long Term Fuel Trim (LTFT) represents the cumulative adjustments made by the engine control unit (ECU) to maintain the optimal air-fuel ratio over a longer period. Unlike Short Term Fuel Trim, which reacts to immediate conditions, LTFT adjusts for longer-term changes in the engineâ€™s performance.
      </p>
      <ul className="info-list">
        <li><strong>What is LTFT?</strong> LTFT is the ECU's long-term adjustment to the air-fuel mixture based on historical data and trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Why is LTFT important?</strong> It helps compensate for long-term variations such as fuel quality changes, engine wear, or sensor drift, ensuring consistent engine performance and emissions.</li>
        <li><strong>How is LTFT measured?</strong> LTFT is also expressed as a percentage. Positive values indicate the ECU is adding fuel over the long term, while negative values mean it's reducing fuel.</li>
        <li><strong>Common issues with LTFT:</strong> Significant deviations from the normal range can indicate issues such as persistent fuel delivery problems or long-term sensor malfunctions.</li>
      </ul>
